    "\n",
    "String is alphanumeric values which are used for any programing requirement. Variables are temporary placeholders which are stored in memory and is used to contain values temporarily for our programming requirement\n",

    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",

    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "As the statement above is trying to concatenate string and int data together, so the statement will result in an error for typecasting. To fix the issue, we can use str(90) instead of 90\n",
